// rts-sim-wasm init — singleton loader.
//
// This module is the ONLY place either the server tick or the
// client prediction stepper should obtain the WASM handle from.
// Both await `initSimWasm()`; concurrent awaiters share one fetch
// + compile via the module-scope Promise cache below.
//
// The WASM artifacts under `./pkg/` are produced by
// `npm run build:wasm` (which calls `wasm-pack build --release
// --target web --out-dir ../src/game/sim-wasm/pkg` from the
// `rts-sim-wasm/` crate at the repo root). They are gitignored —
// `npm run build` runs the wasm build first; `npm run dev`
// reuses whatever pkg/ already contains, so run `build:wasm`
// once after a fresh clone and re-run after any Rust edit.
